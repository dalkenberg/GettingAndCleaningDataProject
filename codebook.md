Extract from the above link:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Data sets
---------
* mean_std_data - data frame containing 66 columns of data pertaining to mean() and stddev() columns from the combined original train and test data sets.
* mean_std_data_avg - data frame containing the average of each of the 66 columns from mean_std_data, grouped by activity and subject

Data manipulation
-----------------
The two tidy data sets are extracted from the original data sourve via the run_analysis.R script
* For mean_std_data The script combines the original data sets, extracts the mean() and stddev() columns and renames the columns to more meaningful column names
* For mean_std_data_avg, the script adds the subject and activity columns to mean_std_data and takes the average of each column grouped by subject and activity.
